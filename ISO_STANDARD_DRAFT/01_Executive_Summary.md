# Executive Summary

The Universal Financial Identifier (UFID) is a proposed global standard designed to provide a universal, secure, and compact identifier for financial accounts across traditional banking systems, payment networks, and blockchain platforms. The UFID standard aims to enhance interoperability across diverse financial ecosystems, providing institutions and users with a singular, standardized format for account identification.

By addressing the limitations of current account identifiers, such as IBAN and blockchain addresses, UFID supports a variety of use cases, from traditional cross-border payments to digital asset transactions. Built with privacy and security in mind, UFID utilizes hashing, salting, and non-human-readable encoding methods to protect sensitive data. Additionally, UFID is designed for future compatibility, offering version control and the capacity for seamless updates to accommodate emerging technologies and transaction types.

## Key Objectives of the UFID Standard

- **Interoperability**: Facilitate cross-platform compatibility with banks, payment providers, and digital asset platforms.
- **Security and Privacy**: Provide a secure, non-human-readable identifier that protects sensitive account data.
- **Global Applicability**: Ensure UFID can be used internationally across various regulatory and technological environments.
- **Future-Proof Design**: Enable adaptation to advancements in cryptographic standards and financial technologies.
