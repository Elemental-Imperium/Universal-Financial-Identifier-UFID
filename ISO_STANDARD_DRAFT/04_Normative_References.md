The UFID standard draws on several established ISO standards to ensure compatibility with existing financial and identification protocols. These standards provide the foundation for UFID's global applicability and alignment with recognized financial practices.

- **ISO 3166-1**: Country codes used within UFID to denote jurisdiction. This standard ensures global applicability by standardizing country representation.
- **ISO 9362**: Structure of BIC/SWIFT codes, adapted within UFID for institution identification. Using this standard helps UFID uniquely identify financial institutions.
- **ISO 20022**: Provides a messaging standard for financial services, which UFID complements by enabling uniform account identification.
- **ISO 4217**: Currency codes used within UFID, relevant to defining the capabilities associated with accounts.
- **ISO/IEC 7812**: Establishes identification methods for issuers and institutions, informing the Institution Code structure within UFID.
- **Cryptographic Standards**: UFID leverages SHA-256 for hashing and Base58 encoding to ensure secure and compact data representation. These techniques are industry standards for maintaining data security and integrity.
