# Scope

The Universal Financial Identifier (UFID) is designed to create a single, compact, and secure identifier for financial accounts. The UFID standard addresses the need for interoperability across traditional financial systems, payment networks, and blockchain-based digital asset systems by providing a unified format for account identification.

## Purpose of UFID

UFID enhances the global financial ecosystem by standardizing the format for account identifiers. With privacy and security as core principles, UFID uses non-human-readable encoding, hashing, and salting to ensure sensitive data protection. By creating a future-proof identifier, UFID can adapt to the evolving needs of financial technology and data privacy regulations.

## Key Features

- **Interoperability**: Enables seamless integration with banks, payment providers, digital wallets, and blockchain networks.
- **Global Applicability**: Suitable for international transactions, cross-border payments, and compliance with jurisdictional standards.
- **Security and Privacy**: Incorporates security measures like hashing and encoding, ensuring data integrity and privacy.
- **Future-Proofing**: Designed to accommodate future extensions and cryptographic advancements, UFID uses version control to manage updates.
