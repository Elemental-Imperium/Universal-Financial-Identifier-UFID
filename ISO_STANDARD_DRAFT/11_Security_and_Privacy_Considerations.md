# Security and Privacy Considerations

The UFID standard incorporates multiple security and privacy features, ensuring that sensitive account data is protected and compliant with data privacy regulations like GDPR.

## 1. Hashing and Salting for Privacy

To protect account identifiers from exposure, UFID uses hashing and salting techniques:

- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Account numbers or blockchain addresses are hashed using SHA-256, providing robust encryption.
- **Institution Code as Salt**: A unique salt derived from the Institution Code prevents identical accounts from producing the same hash across institutions.
- **Non-Reversible Hashing**: The hash is non-reversible, making it impossible to derive the original account number from the UFID.

## 2. Non-Human-Readable Encoding for Capability Codes

To secure transaction capabilities and prevent unauthorized access, the Capability Code is encoded in a non-human-readable format:

- **Bitfield Encoding**: Each capability (e.g., ACH, SWIFT) is represented by a specific bit in a bitfield.
- **Base58 Encoding**: After hashing, Base58 encoding ensures that the final capability code is compact, secure, and non-human-readable.

## 3. Checksum Integrity Verification

The checksum helps to detect accidental or malicious modifications to the UFID:

- **Checksum Calculation**: A checksum is generated by summing ASCII values and applying a modulo operation.
- **Validation**: During transaction processing, the checksum ensures that the UFID has not been altered, providing an extra layer of security.

## 4. Compliance with Global Privacy Regulations

UFID is designed with privacy compliance in mind, meeting regulatory requirements:

- **GDPR Compliance**: By hashing account identifiers and avoiding direct storage of sensitive data, UFID adheres to GDPRâ€™s data minimization and privacy by design principles.
- **Privacy by Design**: UFID avoids storing sensitive data in plain text, relying on hashing and encoding to secure account details.
- **Audit Trail**: The UFID structure allows institutions to track account activity without exposing underlying data, supporting regulatory audits.
